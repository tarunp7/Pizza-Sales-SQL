# Pizza-Sales-SQL
In this project, I used SQL to analyze the sales data of a pizza restaurant. The goal was to gain insights into customer preferences, order patterns, and revenue generation. The dataset contains information on pizza orders, their prices, sizes, and categories, enabling me to address key business questions and improve operations.

The project is divided into three main sections:

1. Basic Queries: These focus on understanding the overall performance, such as the total number of orders, revenue generated, and identifying popular pizzas.

2. Intermediate Queries: These delve deeper into specific trends, such as sales distribution by time, pizza categories, and daily ordering patterns.

3. Advanced Queries: These provide a more in-depth analysis, including revenue contribution by pizza type and category, and a cumulative analysis of revenue over time.

By leveraging SQL to join relevant tables, group data, and perform calculations, I was able to derive actionable insights that can help the pizza restaurant optimize its menu, pricing strategy, and operational hours.
